This research presents a Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) with high gain and wide impedance bandwidth designed for 5G communication systems. The antenna employs a hollow cylindrical DRA excited by a microstrip-fed aperture slot, operating at 15 GHz. The optimized design improves bandwidth and gain by lowering the radiation Q-factor.
